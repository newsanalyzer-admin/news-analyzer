I need a list of online government sources of information such as uscode.house.gov that have either downloadable content or an API

Here are major US government sources with downloadable content or APIs:

Legal & Legislative:

uscode.house.gov - US Code in XML/HTML
congress.gov - Bills, laws, Congressional Record (bulk data available)
govinfo.gov - Government Publishing Office, extensive bulk data downloads
courtlistener.com - Federal and state court opinions (API available)
api.data.gov - Central hub for federal APIs
Economic & Financial:

data.treasury.gov - Treasury data with API
fred.stlouisfed.org - Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED API)
bls.gov/developers - Bureau of Labor Statistics API
census.gov/data/developers - Census Bureau APIs
sec.gov/edgar - SEC filings, bulk data available
Health & Science:

data.cms.gov - Medicare/Medicaid data
clinicaltrials.gov - API for clinical trial data
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api - National Library of Medicine APIs

census.gov/data - Demographic and economic data
niem.gov - National Information Exchange Model
Transportation & Geography:

data.bts.gov - Bureau of Transportation Statistics
Most of these offer REST APIs, bulk downloads, or both. What type of data are you specifically looking for?

I'm building a web application that analyzes news articles for accuracy so I'm looking for sources of information that can be the 'source of truth' so they need to be 'official' or at least reliable

Excellent use case! Here are the most reliable "source of truth" government repositories for fact-checking news:

Legislative & Legal (Primary Sources):

congress.gov - Official bills, laws, voting records, Congressional Record
govinfo.gov - Authenticated government documents (Federal Register, CFR, Supreme Court opinions)
supremecourt.gov - Official Supreme Court decisions and dockets
regulations.gov - Federal rulemaking and public comments
pacer.gov - Federal court records (requires account, small fees)
Executive Branch & Policy:

whitehouse.gov - Official statements, executive orders, press briefings
state.gov - Official foreign policy positions, press releases
federalregister.gov - Daily journal of US government (regulations, executive orders)
Economic Data:

bls.gov - Employment, inflation, wage data (CPI, unemployment rates)
bea.gov - GDP, economic indicators
census.gov - Population, demographic data
treasury.gov - Government finances, debt data
sec.gov/edgar - Corporate filings (for business news verification)
Health & Safety:

cdc.gov - Disease data, health statistics
fda.gov - Drug approvals, recalls, safety data
who.int - Global health data (international)
Crime & Justice:

fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr - Uniform Crime Reports
bjs.gov - Bureau of Justice Statistics
Scientific:

noaa.gov - Weather, climate data
usgs.gov - Earthquakes, natural disasters, geography
nasa.gov - Space, climate science
International (Non-US):

un.org - UN resolutions, reports
europa.eu - EU official documents
data.worldbank.org - Global economic indicators
Key Considerations for Your App:

Timeliness: Congress.gov and Federal Register are updated regularly
Authentication: Govinfo.gov provides digitally signed documents for verification
APIs: Most have APIs or structured data feeds
Archived versions: Check archive.gov for historical snapshots to verify timing of policy changes
For your accuracy analyzer, I'd prioritize govinfo.gov (most comprehensive authenticated documents), congress.gov (legislative claims), and bls.gov/bea.gov (economic claims) as your core foundation.
